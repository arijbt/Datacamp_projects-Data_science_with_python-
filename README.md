# Datacamp_projects-Data_science_with_python-
These are the 6 projects that I have done during data science with python track on Datacamp.

In this track, I have learnt how this versatile language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, I got hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more.
Then, I worked with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques I need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP).
